**Abstract:** This study introduces an order-lifted inversion/retrieval method for implementing high-order schemes within the framework of an unstructured-mesh-based finite-volume method. This method defines a special representation called the data order-lifted inversion of neighbor cells (DOLINC) differential, which transforms the degrees of freedom of wide templates into differentials of various orders stored in local grid cells. Furthermore, to retrieve the original far-field information without bias during the reconstruction/interpolation of face values, the corresponding accurate inversion formulas are derived based on the defined DOLINC differentials. The order-lifted inversion method can be applied to multi-dimensional polyhedral-mesh solvers by considering the influence of grid non-uniformity on high-order schemes. It seamlessly accommodates multi-process parallel computing for high-order methods without requiring special consideration for the boundary interface. This method not only enhances the numerical accuracy of second-order finite-volume methods, but also demonstrates a significant computational-speed advantage over similar methods. A series of benchmark cases, including the linear advection, Burgers, and Euler equations, are comprehensively validated to assess the practical performance of the method. The results indicate that the unstructured-mesh high-order schemes implemented based on this method achieve theoretical accuracy in practical computations and substantially reduce computational costs compared with methods that increase grid resolution.
